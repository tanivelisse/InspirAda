### Objectives 

Create a digital space for users to find and share blog posts about  women in the tech industry who have inspire them in hopes to motivate more women and girls to pursue a career in tech. 

### The name

InspirAda is a word play between the word "inspirada" that means inspired women in Spanish and "Ada" for Ada Lovelace who is considered one of the first computer programmers. Ada is also my biggest inspiration for this project.
